A customizable man-in-the-middle proxy with support for HTTP and HTTPS capturing.

## Installing

I'm currently working on getting PyPi's `mitm` page. As of right now, you can install via GitHub:

```
pip install http://github.com/synchronizing/mitm
```

Note that OpenSSL 1.1.1 or greater is required.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://synchronizing.github.io/mitm/). 

## Using

By itself `mitm` is not very special. You can boot it up and view debug messages quite easily:

```python
from mitm import MITM, Config
import logging

config = Config(log_level=logging.DEBUG)
MITM.start(config)
```

`mitm` becomes more useful when you either inherit and extend `mitm.MITM`, or utilize the built-in middleware system.

### Inheriting

For more complex modifications to `mitm` you can inherit from `mitm.MITM` to modify the default behavior of how the proxy works. Things like modifying the default TLS configuration, modifying connection behavior, or even changing client behavior can be done.

### Middleware

`mitm` has support for custom middlewares to allow programmatic customizations to incoming and outgoing web requests. To initialize a middleware, simply create a class that inherits from `mitm.Middleware`:

```python
from mitm import MITM, Config, Middleware

class PrintFlow(Middleware):
    async def client_data(self, request) -> bytes:
        print("Client sent:\n\n\t", request, "\n")
        return request

    async def server_data(self, response) -> bytes:
        print("Server replied:\n\n\t", response, "\n")
        return response

config = Config()
config.add_middleware(PrintFlow)
MITM.start(config)
```

Running the above, and then in a different script running:

```python
import requests

proxies = {"http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888", "https": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"}
requests.get("https://httpbin.org/anything", proxies=proxies, verify=False)
```

Will yield the following print-out:

```

You can modify the request and response data in the middleware before returning. You can read more of this in the documentation.
